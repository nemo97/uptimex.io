# About US

My name is Subhas Sing, and I am native of Jhargram, a rural district in West Bengal, India.

After completing my 10th grade at my village school, I moved to Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) and joined City College for my Higher Secondary education, which I completed in 1999. Subsequently, I was admitted to Jadavpur University, where I pursued a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. After graduating in 2003, I worked for various private software companies. In 2007, I relocated to the United States for work and have been living in Phoenix, a desert city in the southwestern United States and the largest city in the Grand Canyon State of Arizona.
